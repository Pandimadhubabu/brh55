### Hello there _stranger_,

I'm Brandon, a self-taught, user-centric developer (used to be a designer!) living in San Jose, California!

Currently, I'm working as a full-stack developer within a Sales-driven innovation team at [Cisco](https://cisco.com). While, I'm an avid coder, I mainly enjoy the process of bootstrapping project and adapting to the needs of a project. If I'm not stationed at a coffee shop, you can catch me at one of the oldest Silicon Valley toastmasters club, [ArtICCulators](https://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club/00005414-00005414). 

As much as I enjoy roaming the interwebs, I'm also passionate about exploring the world with the dreams of one day becoming a digital nomad.
