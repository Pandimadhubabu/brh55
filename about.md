Hello there,

I'm Brandon, a self-taught web developer and designer living in San Jose. Currently, I'm working as a Full-Stack Developer within a sales innovation team at [Cisco](https://cisco.com). I'm an avid coder and spend weekends completing small projects or contributing to open source projects. I enjoy being a mentor, mentee, and a toastmaster!

Feel free to contact me at through [email](mailto:brandonhim@live.com).
