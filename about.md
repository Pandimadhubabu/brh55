  If you came here for free ice cream, I'm sorry to disappoint.

Hello there,

I'm Brandon, a self-taught web developer and designer living in Philadelphia. Currently, I'm working as a Front-end Engineer at [Urban Outfitters](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/index.jsp), and attending school at [Drexel University](http://drexel.edu/).

In my past life, I worked behind a pharmacy, inside a factory, and within a design office. On my free time I'm pulling all-nighters at hackathons, cooking unusual recipes, or shooting with my Fuji x100.
