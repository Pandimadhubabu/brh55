Hello there,

I'm Brandon, a self-taught web developer and designer living in Philadelphia. Currently, I'm working as a Front-end Engineer at [Urban Outfitters](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/index.jsp), and studying Information Technology at [Drexel University](http://drexel.edu/). I'm an avid coder and spend weekends completing small projects or contributing to open source projects. I enjoy being a mentor and advocate self-teaching.

Open Source/Github projects I've contributed to (donated, community involvement,documentation, code fixes, etc):

- [MODx](https://modx.com/)

    MODX Revolution is the web content management platform for those that truly care about no-compromise design and exceptional user experience.

- [HTMLy](https://www.htmly.com/)

    Databaseless Blogging Platform, Flat-File Blog and Flat-File CMS

- [Bitbucket-slack-pr-hook](https://github.com/lfilho/bitbucket-slack-pr-hook)

    Receive Pull Requests notifications from BitBucket and send them to Slack.

    Angular Directive of Swiper.js.

- [slack-pokemon](https://github.com/rvinluan/slack-pokemon)

When I'm not coding, you can catch me cooking unusual recipes, or shooting with my Fuji x100.
